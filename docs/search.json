The presentations can be on a variety of topics, including research, projects, internships, a topic you wanted to investigate, a paper that you found interesting, and more. Anything that is appropriate for the graduate-student level audience that could be of interest to the graduate students of this department is welcomed.\nThe GSS welcomes, and ENCOURAGES, anyone who is interested to attend. This includes undergraduates, faculty, and staff. This is open to ALL graduate students. We are hoping to get a variety of topics and perspectives. Please email ucr.grad.stat@gmail.com your name as soon as possible if you would be willing to put together a presentation, we would be delighted to have you.\nUpcoming Presentations\nParallel Computing with HPCC\nPresenter: Isaac Quintanilla Salinas\nDate: 3/11/2021\nPresentation\nPast Presentations\nReal-Time Classification of Atrial Fibrillation using ECG Characteristics\nPresenter: Jericho Lawson\nDate: 2/4/2021\nIntroduction to Tidyverse\nPresenter: Kim Phan\nDate: 1/28/2021\nSEMI-PARAMETRIC ESTIMATION IN A TWO-COMPONENT LOCATION-SHIFTED MIXTURE MODEL WITH PARTIALLY KNOWN COMPONENT LABELS\nPresenter: Bradley Lubich\nDate: 12/10/2020\nHOW TO PREPARE FOR DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIPS: PREREQUISITES, INTERVIEWS AND PROJECTS\nPresenter: Jinhui (Jerry) Yang\nDate: 11/05/2020\nASYMMETRIC LOSS FUNCTIONS IN MCMC ESTIMATION\nPresenter: Deepak Bastola\nDate: 06/02/2020\nTHE RCPP PACKAGE: INTEGRATING R AND C++\nPresenter: Tyler Brannan\nDate: 05/05/2020\nVARYING-COEFFICIENT MODELS\nPresenter: Isaac Quintanilla Salinas\nDate: 04/21/2020\nA BAYESIAN LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF COUNT DATA WITH GAUSSIAN PROCESSES\nPresenter: Samantha VanSchalkwyk\nDate: 03/12/2020\nBUILDING SIMULTANEOUS CONFIDENCE BANDS FOR FUNCTIONS\nPresenter: Jinhui Yang\nDate: 03/05/2020\nJOINT SURVIVAL-LONGITUDINAL MODELING\nPresenter: Tyler Brannan\nDate: 02/27/2020\nData Science Internships\nPresenter: Dong Ji\nDate: 01/30/2020\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals Internships Recap and Joint Modeling of Longitudinal and Time-to-Event Data\nPresenter: Luke Klein\nDate: 01/16/2020\nDivide-and-Conquer for Expectile Regression Processes\nPresenter: Zhen Zhang\nDate: 12/06/2019\nIdentifying the Best Predictive Biomarker in Pharmacogenomics\nPresenter: Song Zhai\nDate: 11/22/2019\nBayesian Sensitivity Analysis to Adjust for Unmeasured Confounder in Causal Inference\nPresenter: Bibby Zhou\nDate: 11/08/2019\n\n\n\n",
